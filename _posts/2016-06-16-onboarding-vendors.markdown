[comment]: # Here's what I wrote out initially:
[comment]: # Onboarding a vendor to understand all of a state's Medicaid, child welfare, or
[comment]: # other major system is indeed a big task.  These are complex systems with a lot
[comment]: # of policy, regulations, and laws tied up in them.  Indeed, bringing a vendor on
[comment]: # to work on the system will take some time.
[comment]: #
[comment]: # However, with a modular procurement strategy, the scope of each task is greatly
[comment]: # reduced.  Instead of incoming vendors needing to understand the entire system,
[comment]: # they only need to understand the small piece they are working on and its
[comment]: # touch-points with other parts of the system.  It is not necessary for them to
[comment]: # understand Medicaid or child welfare as a whole.
