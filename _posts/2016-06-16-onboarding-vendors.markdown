title: Onboarding a vendor takes a long time. How can we expect to onboard several?
category: Modular Procurement

Onboarding a vendor to understand all of a state's Medicaid, child welfare, or
other major system is indeed a big task.  These are complex systems with a lot
of policy, regulations, and laws tied up in them.  Indeed, bringing a vendor on
to work on the system will take some time.

However, with a modular procurement strategy, the scope of each task is greatly
reduced.  Instead of incoming vendors needing to understand the entire system,
they only need to understand the small piece they are working on and its
touch-points with other parts of the system.  It is not necessary for them to
understand Medicaid or child welfare as a whole.
