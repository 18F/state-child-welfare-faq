[comment]: # Here's what I wrote out initially:
[comment]: # One of the biggest risks with waterfall is trying to define all of
[comment]: # the system requirements up front.  Requirements _will_ change over
[comment]: # time, but with a waterfall approach, you're locked in until the
[comment]: # system is complete.  Agile acknowledges that these changes will
[comment]: # happen and chooses not to try to list all of the requirements.
[comment]: # Instead, you find only the minimum requirements necessary for
[comment]: # the immediate next step.
[comment]: #
[comment]: # Perhaps the most significant risk with agile is not having a
[comment]: # _vision_ of the end goal.  While an agile approach does not try
[comment]: # to define all of the system requirements, it does depend on having
[comment]: # a high-level view of roughly what the outcome should look like.
[comment]: # Lacking that, an agile project can wander aimlessly and never get
[comment]: # anywhere.
[comment]: #
[comment]: # Another potential risk is losing track of that vision as the
[comment]: # process iterates.  A good product owner is responsible for keeping
[comment]: # the project on-track from an end-goal perspective and not let the
[comment]: # team get lost in new ideas (though new ideas should not be
[comment]: # discouraged!) and iterate forever.
