title: We have heard several risks to the waterfall approach.  What are the risks to agile approach?
category: Agile

One of the biggest risks with waterfall is trying to define all of the system requirements up front.  Requirements _will_ change over time, but with a waterfall approach, you're locked in until the system is complete.  Agile acknowledges that these changes will happen and chooses not to try to list all of the requirements.  Instead, you find only the minimum requirements necessary for the immediate next step.

Perhaps the most significant risk with agile is not having a _vision_ of the end goal.  While an agile approach does not try to define all of the system requirements, it does depend on having a high-level view of roughly what the outcome should look like.  Lacking that, an agile project can wander aimlessly and never get anywhere.

Another potential risk is losing track of that vision as the process iterates.  A good product owner is responsible for keeping the project on-track from an end-goal perspective and not let the team get lost in new ideas (though new ideas should not be discouraged!) and iterate forever.
