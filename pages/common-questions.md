There are a number of questions and concerns we've heard expressed in many of our workshops and conversations. Here's how we answer a few of them:

**How do we evaluate vendors if they don’t estimate costs up front and the deliverables aren’t fixed? How is this better than knowing upfront costs and all deliverables and timelines?**

Vendors would still be submitting proposals with associated costs, deliverables, etc. The difference with modular procurement is that what they are proposing against is much smaller and more frequent.

**The federal government has up to 60 days to approve our Advance Planning Documents and our RFPs for projects involving federal grants. Doing more small procurements just means more delay. How can that be improved?**

18F is committed to working with our federal partners to reduce the burden on state agencies to get smaller contracts approved. The approval cycle is to ensure that states are mitigating risk—and one of the best ways to do that is with shorter, lower-cost contracts. 

**Can I just buy off 18Fs Agile Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA)?**

18F’s Agile BPA is only available for use by 18F and its partner agencies. As 18F can directly support states by establishing an Intergovernmental Cooperative Agreement with them, then any state or local entity can avail themselves of the services offered on it.

**Who will I call when something goes wrong after launch?**

We work to ensure that an appropriate acquisition plan is in place, so that an open source solution will be maintained, just like closed source software.

**How can we ensure accountability without having a single systems integrator?**

Paradoxically, the idea that a single systems integrator provides ultimate accountability and maximum control isn’t supported by decades of large-scale IT projects that used this approach. In the same way that most manufacturing companies rely on multiple suppliers, companies that need digital products have expanded their procurement practices with multisourcing, to reduce the type of risk that comes from vendor lock-in with a single systems integrator.
